# Odds And Ends

#### Introduction
This is my attempt to push myself out of my comfort zone in several ways by creating a super simple program every day, and then walking away. As a perfectionist, I tend to want to refactor *forever* andmy projects become endless. I am also going to focus on some of my weak points, and indeed make those part of the rules.

#### Rules
1. Write a unit test before starting a project
2. Only use vim.
3. Complete exactly one project per day, start to finish. No more. No less.
4. Aim for 30 - 60 minutes spent per project.

#### Ideas
forms
hover effects
animations
