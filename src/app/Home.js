        <h2>Coded In A Day</h2>
        <p>By Aaron Price</p>
        <p>On April 24th, 2017, I started building a small project, every day. <br />
            I don't know when I'll stop. Some days they're pretty small, other times not so much. <br />
            It depends on whether I can spend the whole day, or just a lunch break, working on it.</p>
    </div>
